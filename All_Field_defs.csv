"Doing Business Rank","Integer","Economies are ranked on their ease of doing business, from 1–189. A high ease of doing business ranking means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the starting and operation of a local firm. The rankings are determined by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores on 10 topics, each consisting of several indicators, giving equal weight to each topic. The rankings for all economies are benchmarked to June 2015.","World Bank Doing Business Group 2015"
"Enforcing Contracts Rank","Integer","Measure of the strength of legal institutions and includes data on procedures, time and cost to resolve a commercial dispute. ","World Bank Doing Business Group 2015"
"Doing Business Indicator","Numeric","The World Bank’s Doing Business project collects quantitative data that measures the business regulation environments for 189 economies around the world across 11 indicator sets. These indicator sets, shown in the table below are broken into 2 main categories: “complexity and cost of regulatory processes” and “strength of legal institutions”. The aggregate measure, called “Distance to the frontier”, provides an index for each of the 11 indicator sets as well as an overall score for the economy. The distance to the frontier score shows the distance of each economy to the best performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since the first report in 2005. The idea is that the distance to the frontier reflects the gap an economy has between its current state and the best observed performance for the indicator. For each indicator set, additional metrics are also provided. For example, the indicator set “enforcing contracts” includes the average cost (as a percentage of the claim), time (in days), and procedures needed to enforce a contract.","World Bank Doing Business Group 2015"
"Enforcing Contracts Indicator","Numeric","The contract enforcement distance to the frontier index is a subset of the Doing Business index and measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local first-instance court. The data are collected through study of the codes of civil procedure and other court regulations as well as questionnaires completed by local litigation lawyers and judges. The distance to the frontier score is the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the component indicators.","World Bank Doing Business Group 2015"
