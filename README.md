# Investments in Watershed Services
Global State and Potential Scope of Investments in Watershed Services for Large Cities

#This Research
The term ecosystem services refers to services to humans provided by healthy and functioning ecosystems, e.g., pollination, storm water protection, and erosion control. One management strategy for the provision and maintenance of ecosystem services is to establish payment systems between users and suppliers. These payments are designed to offset incentives to use resources that may damage their ability to provide ecosystems services. An example is city dwellers paying watershed inhabitants to maintain watershed features that filter and provide water to the city. As part of an interdisciplinary team funded by the National Socio-Environmental Synthesis Center, I developed a random forest model to evaluate conditions correlated with the existence of payments for watershed services that supply drinking water to large cities around the globe. Our team has one published manuscript in Ecology and Society and our second is in revision at Nature Communications.
